## Aim
After needing to share my dotfiles across my laptop and desktop I found multiple appealing and inspiring tools:
- [toml-bombadil](https://github.com/oknozor/toml-bombadil)
- [yolk](https://github.com/elkowar/yolk)

But as I tried them, I found the experience to be incoherent. This project aims to become (I know that it is far from perfect) a **all-in-one** solution for dotfile managment including a GUI. 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Complete CLI functionality
- [ ] First GUI release
- [ ] Dynamic GUIs for apps through plugins
